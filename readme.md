This is a skill testing project, build base on:

- Node 16.16.0
- Nvm 8.11.0

Main packages i've used:

- React
- ViteJS
- Formik
- React router dom
- Tailwindcss
- Sass

All the component in this project was build from scratch, not using any UI framework.

If you see and functions or components is missing, contact me to make it as perfect as possible.

Here is the installation guide:

1. Clone the project
2. CD to the project's directory
3. Run the command `npm install`
4. Then the npm installation has done, write `npm run dev` to run the project and `npm run build` to build the project for deployment.
